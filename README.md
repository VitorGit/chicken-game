This is a game I made as a frist semester project at my college. 
The objective is to use W/D and left/right arrow to tilt a plataform, allowing the chicken in it to avoid incoming rocks. 
The gameplay was based on an old arcade game called Ice Cold Beer.
 
The game was written in Lua and rendered using Love2D.
